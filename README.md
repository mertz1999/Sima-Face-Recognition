# Sima Face-Recognition

Sima is an Open-source face Recognition project. It`s based on ResNet architecture and TripletLoss(This loss has been developed by google team).  
We use CASIA-WebFace and Sima Dataset for training and LFW dataset for validation.

## Deployment

Explain included files:

- ***main.py*** : Start training loop.  
- ***loss.py*** : Implemetation of triplet loss function.  
- ***resnet.py*** : Implemetation of ResNet 18 & 34 architecture.  
- ***utils.py*** : Some function.  

Explain Folders:
